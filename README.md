SubLit is a platform where students can post listings and students looking to sublet can find places. They can then chat in the web app to discuss a sublet agreement.

## Architecture

There are essentially five pages in this web app:  
1. sign in/up: where users can create accounts or sign in. checks for a @dartmouth.edu email address  
2. main page: all the listings are here. can search by keyword or sort by different things  
3. single listing: each listing expands into its own page with more detail and information
4. new listing: students with leases can create a new listing
5. chat: where students can talk to one another about listings

May also add a profile page for each person where they can manage their listings, update email etc. 

We're using Boostrap to help design the app. 


## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc

## Deployment

We're going to deploy the page on surge and have the listings stored in mongoDB's cloud services.
